"# HW2" 
In this project we want to simulate a faculty.
This is a project that has several classes. They are: student, labboratory, academic department and faculty.
Firt class is Student. It stores information about each student such as firstname , lastname, ID and grade.
Second class is Lab. It is a laboratory that can have several students. Each laboratory has a day and capacity.
The number of students in lab can not be more than it's capacity.
Third class is Academic department , which has seeral laboratory. Each department has it's own name.
The capacity of each department is received from user.
And the last class is faculty. It consist of group of departments.

The important point is that you can print the list of departments of each faculty.
In addition, in each facility if you give the name of a department , you can print it's laboratories.
And if you give the name of the department and the number of laboratory , you can print the information of tha laboratory.
